AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards WHEN I view the source code

Right Click in your browser window to view the source code from inspect on firefox or windows Edge or use the google DevTools from settings more tools.

THEN I find semantic HTML elements article

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements The !DOCTYPE Declaration Head, body, main-content, footer

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css"

WHEN I view the image elements THEN I find accessible alt attributes

img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt="search engine optimization

WHEN I view the heading attributes THEN they fall in sequential order div lu li a

WHEN I view the title element THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
